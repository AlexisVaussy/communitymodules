1) MeVisLab2.2.1-Release
   The project 
     https://mevislabmodules.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mevislabmodules/trunk/Community/General/Sources/ML/MLCSOToRTStructure
   According to a bug in the windows installers of the MeVislab2.2.1 release 
   the library files oslog.lib and oflog_d.lib are missing. Since these files 
   are not needed by this project its link statement was manually removed
   from the windows <MeVisLabInstallPath>\Packages\MeVis\ThirdParty\Configuration\MeVis_ThirdParty.pri 
   files in the installed MeVisLab versions. In this way this project can also 
   be compiled if you check out this project on your own.

2) MeVisLab2.2.1-Release, VC10-64:
   The projects 
     Project https://mevislabmodules.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mevislabmodules/trunk/UMD/METK/Sources/common/,
     Project https://mevislabmodules.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mevislabmodules/trunk/UMD/METK/Sources/ML/METKLiftChart
   and some other (dependent) projects fail due to a complex linker symbol 
   problem in the MLObjMgr project in the VC10-64 release of MeVisLab2.2.1. 
   This will be correctly fixed in the MeVisLab2.3 release, in the current VC10-64-setup it is done with a workaround
   in the file 
     https://svn-mms.mt.mevis.lokal/dev/branches/mevislab/integration/MeVisLab/Standard/Configuration/MeVisLab_Standard.pri
   by adding a linker flag allowing multiple linker symbols in the MLObjMgr project settings (l. 285):
     contains(QMAKE_COMPILER_DEFINES, _MSC_VER=1600) {
       win32:QMAKE_LFLAGS +=  /FORCE:MULTIPLE
     }

3) Although the ToolRunner of MeVisLab2.2.1 requires an NSIS version 2.36 or higher it must be a version 2.43 or 
   higher if you build your own installers against the release MeVisLab2.2.1 versions. An appropriate NSIS version 
   is installed on the CommunityBuild server.
