1) MeVisLab2.2.1-Release
  The project 
    https://mevislabmodules.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mevislabmodules/trunk/Community/General/Sources/ML/MLCSOToRTStructure
  According to a bug in the the windows installers of the MeVislab2.2.1 release 
  the library files oslog.lib and oflog_d.lib are missing. Since these files 
  are not needed by this project its link statement was manually removed
  from the windows <MeVisLabInstallPath>\Packages\MeVis\ThirdParty\Configuration\MeVis_ThirdParty.pri 
  files in the installed MeVisLab versions. In this way this project can also 
  be compiled if you check out this project on your own.

2) MeVisLab2.2.1-Release, VC10-64:
  The projects 
    Project https://mevislabmodules.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mevislabmodules/trunk/UMD/METK/Sources/common/,
    Project https://mevislabmodules.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mevislabmodules/trunk/UMD/METK/Sources/ML/METKLiftChart
  and some other (dependent) projects fail due to a complex linker symbol 
  problem in the MLObjMgr project in the VC10-64 release of MeVisLab2.2.1. 
  This will be fixed in the MeVisLab2.3 release.
