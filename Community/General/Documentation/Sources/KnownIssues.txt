In this file known issues of the MeVisLab Community Builds are listed.

1) MeVisLab2.2.1-Release
Project .../Packages/Community/General/Sources/ML/MLCSOToRTStructure
According to a bug in the the windows installers of the MeVislab2.2.1 release 
the library files oslog.lib and oflog_d.lib are missing. Since these files 
are not needed by this project its link statement was manually removed
from the windows Packages\MeVis\ThirdParty\Configuration\MeVis_ThirdParty.pri 
files in the installed MeVisLab versions. In this way this project can also 
be compiled if you check out this project on your own.

2) MeVisLab2.2.1-Release, VC10-64:
The projects 
Project .../Packages/UMD/METK/Sources/common,
Project .../Packages/UMD/METK/Sources/ML/METKLiftChart
and some other (dependent) projects fail due to a complex linker symbol 
problem in the MLObjMgr project in the VC10-64 release of MeVisLab2.2.1. 
This will be fixed in the MeVisLab2.3 release.
