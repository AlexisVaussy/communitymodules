This is an Adobe FrameMaker 9.0 project using a structured framemaker EDD based on DocBook
4.4. Saving this FrameMaker file as XML will produce a valid DocBook XML file, that, however,
needs some adaptation to comply with the MeVisLab DocBook version. Execute the script file
'adaptDocBookXML.py' to apply those changes.

  - See Adobe document 'Migrating from Unstructured to Structured FrameMaker' on how to setup
    FrameMaker to use the custom EDD 'EDD_DocBook_4.4_Felix.fm'.

  - When saving this file as PDF please make sure to set Adobe Distiller RGB color space to
    'Apple RGB' otherwise images will be too dark.
