# Syntax of this file:
# Each row of this file must contain 4 entries (empty lines or
# lines starting with "#" are ignored - please use this to comment
# your changes!):
#
# What: What should be build. This must be either the directory 
#       containing the "config.txt"-file or the configuration file
#       itself. The path names must be relative to 
#       $(PACKAGE_DIR)/Configuration/Installers.
#
# When: Contains a Time-Spec, at which days the installer should be
#       build. This can be a specific day, a range of days or a
#       partial range, telling until when or from when an installer
#       should be build. Two special Time-Specs are "never" and
#       "always" for skipping an installer or build build it always.
#
#       Example Time-Specs:
#       2005.09.20             Build this installer only one day
#       2005.09.01-2005.09.30  Build this installer the whole month September
#       2005.10.01-            Build this installer from October, 1st
#       -2005.10.01            Build this installer until October, 1st
#
#       A Time-Spec must not contain any whitespace. It must follow
#       the scheme illustrated by the examples exactly. Otherwise the
#       installer will not be build.
#
# Who:  If you create a new Installer, you should add a mail-username
#       here. If the creation of the installer fails, the user gets a
#       mail, informing about the failure and where the short and long
#       Log-Files of the Installer-Script can be found. This allows you to
#       fix errors fast and to always be sure, that your installers are
#       ready when you need them.
#
# Where: Tell the MasterBuilder, on which platform the installer
#       should be build. This can be
#         "windows" for Windows installer,
#         "macos" for Mac OS X installer,
#         "linux" for Linux installer,
#         "unix" for Mac OS X _AND_ Linux installer,
#         "*" for all platforms, or
#         a comma-seperated list of operating systems.
#
# There are two possible Installer-Config-Files for each MeVisLab package:
# - "MasterBuilderInstallers_Nightly.txt"
# - "MasterBuilderInstallers_Continuous.txt"
#
#
#
# The Installer Task collects all installers to build from this
# file. The comment-line above a block of installers is used to
# generate a header line in the index-file of the directory, where the
# installers are copied to. Example:
#
#     # My fancy Valentines Day Installers
#     MeVisLabFlowers                             2007.02.14  userA
#     MeVisLabRibbons                             2007.02.14  userB
#     MeVisLabTruffles/MyInstallerConfigFile.txt  2007.02.14  userC
#
# The block above would generate the three installers, and the comment
# above will generate the header line "My fancy Valentines Day
# Installers" in the installer index table, which is accessible
# through the "All Installers" link from the Report page.
